Here are the **basic tools and technologies you’ll commonly use to develop React.js applications** — from writing code to building, debugging, and deploying your app:

---

## 🧠 **1. Code Editor / IDE**

You need a place to write your code:

* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** – the most popular choice with great extensions for React (snippets, formatting, linting). ([andreadams.com.br][1])
* Other editors: **WebStorm**, **Sublime Text**, etc. ([MoldStud][2])

---

## 🛠️ **2. Project Setup Tools**

These help *bootstrap* and organize your React apps:

### 📦 Create React App

* A CLI tool that quickly creates a working React project with sensible defaults (bundler, dev server, build config). ([Opensource.com][3])

### ⚡ Vite

* A modern, *very fast* build and dev server tool for React projects — often preferred over older tools like Webpack. ([Telerik.com][4])

### 🧱 Webpack

* A module bundler that packages your app and assets into optimized bundles for production. ([designgurus.io][5])

---

## 📜 **3. Package Manager**

Used to install and manage dependencies:

* **npm** (Node Package Manager) — most common
* **Yarn** — an alternative with faster installs

Both let you add libraries such as React Router, Redux, etc.

---

## 📦 **4. Libraries You’ll Commonly Use**

React itself is just a UI library — other tools add commonly needed features:

### ⚙️ State-Management

To manage shared app data:

* **Redux Toolkit** — popular for complex state logic. ([iroidsolutions.com][6])
* Alternatives: **Zustand**, **Recoil**, etc.

### 📍 React Router

For navigation and managing urls in *single-page applications*. ([rootstack.com][7])

### 📊 Data / Server State

* **React Query (TanStack Query)** — simplifies server state fetching/caching. ([iroidsolutions.com][6])

---

## 🧪 **5. Testing Tools**

Make sure your app works correctly:

* **Jest** — JavaScript testing framework for unit/integration tests. ([iroidsolutions.com][6])
* **React Testing Library** — focuses on testing UI from the user’s perspective. ([Omni Academy][8])

---

## 🧹 **6. Code Quality Tools**

Keep code clean and consistent:

* **ESLint** – linter to catch errors and enforce style, with React-specific rules. ([ويكيبيديا][9])
* **Prettier** – automatic code formatter to keep style consistent across files.

---

## 🧪 **7. Debugging / Dev Tools**

Inspect and debug your components:

* **React Developer Tools browser extension** – view component tree and props/state. ([Shiv Technolabs Pvt. Ltd.][10])

---

## 🎛️ **8. UI / Component Libraries (Optional)**

Prebuilt UI elements to speed up design:

* **Material-UI**, **Evergreen**, **React Belle**, etc. ([Opensource.com][3])

---

## 📚 **9. Component Development Tools**

Great for building reusable components:

* **Storybook** – develop and test UI components in isolation. ([Opensource.com][3])

---

## 🧠 **10. (Optional) Meta-Frameworks**

If you want more structure or SSR (server-side rendering):

* **Next.js** – adds routing, SSR, static generation and more to React. ([designgurus.io][5])

---

## 📌 Quick Workflow Example

1. **Set up** your project with Create React App or Vite. ([Opensource.com][3])
2. **Write components** in JSX + JavaScript/TypeScript.
3. **Manage state** using React or Redux. ([iroidsolutions.com][6])
4. **Add routing** with React Router. ([rootstack.com][7])
5. **Test** with Jest + React Testing Library. ([Omni Academy][8])
6. **Lint & format** with ESLint + Prettier. ([ويكيبيديا][9])
7. **Build & deploy** with Vite/CRA build for production. ([Telerik.com][4])

If you want, I can tailor a **starter toolchain recommendation** based on whether you’re a beginner or building large apps!
