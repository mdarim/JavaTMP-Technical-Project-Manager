Here’s a **practical *Advanced Java* training course outline** that you can use to structure a hands-on syllabus for learners who already know core Java fundamentals (OOP, basic syntax, exceptions, collections) and want to move into **real-world Java development**. This combines common topics from enterprise-level courses and advanced training programs. ([Just Academy][1])

* Basics of Docker for Java apps
  👉 *Practical:* Package and deploy a microservice using Docker. ([Reddit][5])

---

## **Capstone Project**

**Goal:** Apply cumulative learning
Sample project ideas:

* **Employee Management System:** Web UI, JDBC backend, multithreading reports
* **Inventory REST API:** Spring Boot + Database
* **Chat Application:** Multithreaded server & client

---

# 🧪 **Assessment & Practice**

* Weekly coding assignments
* Live problem-solving labs
* Code reviews & pair programming sessions

---

## 📅 **Suggested Duration**

| Phase                              | Duration  |
|------------------------------------|-----------|
| Fundamentals Review                | 1 week    |
| Advanced Collections & Concurrency | 2 weeks   |
| JDBC & XML                         | 1.5 weeks |
| Servlets & JSP                     | 2 weeks   |
| Spring Boot & Enterprise           | 2.5 weeks |
| Capstone                           | 2 weeks   |

⏱ *Total:* ~11 weeks (adjustable based on format)

---

## 📌 **Notes**

* Include real **hands-on exercises** after every major topic.
* Use tools like **GitHub**, **Postman**, and **Docker** in labs.
* Final capstone should integrate multiple modules (web + DB + concurrency).
